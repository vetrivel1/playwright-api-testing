The project dependencies were installed successfully, and the Playwright test suite ran without any issues. Both tests in `features/auth/auth.test.js` passed:

- Login with valid credentials: **Passed**
- Login with invalid credentials: **Passed**

Your project is set up and running correctly. If you want to run specific tests, view results, or perform other actions, let me know!

6] ERROR (40879): Request failed with status 400: {"error":"Missing password"}

---

_**Assistant**_

The error message:

```
[15:38:50.026] ERROR (40879): Request failed with status 400: {"error":"Missing password"}
```

means that a test attempted to log in to the API without providing a password, and the API responded with a 400 Bad Request, indicating that the password field was missing.

This is expected behavior for a negative test case. In your test output, you can see:

- One test checks login with valid credentials (which passed).
- Another test checks login with invalid credentials (in this case, missing password), and the API correctly returned an error.

The test is verifying that the API returns the correct error when required fields are missing. The log message is informational and confirms that your negative test case is working as intended.

**Summary:**  
This is not a problem—it's a sign that your test for invalid login (missing password) is working correctly. If you want to suppress this error log or handle it differently, let me know!
