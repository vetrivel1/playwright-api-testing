_**Assistant**_

The repository git@github.com:ilhamaditya/playwright-api-101.git is a GitHub repository, and based on its name, it likely contains introductory or example code for using Playwright to test APIs.

Here's a breakdown of what you can expect from such a repository:

- **playwright**: Playwright is a Node.js library for browser automation, often used for end-to-end testing of web applications. While it's primarily known for UI/browser testing, it can also be used for API testing.
- **api-101**: The "101" usually means it's an introductory or beginner-level resource. "API" suggests the focus is on testing APIs (likely REST APIs) rather than just browser UIs.

### What you might find in this repo:
- Example Playwright test scripts for making HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to APIs.
- Demonstrations of assertions on API responses (status codes, response bodies, headers).
- Setup instructions for running Playwright in a Node.js environment.
- Possibly some sample APIs or mock servers for testing purposes.

### How to explore or use it:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:ilhamaditya/playwright-api-101.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (usually with npm or yarn):
   ```sh
   cd playwright-api-101
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the tests** (often with a command like):
   ```sh
   npx playwright test
   ```
4. **Explore the code**: Look for files in the `tests/` or `specs/` directory, or files ending in `.spec.js` or `.test.js`.
